# rowrow.io
## Website experiment

'Hello World' Javascript fullstack experiment.

Deployed at www.rowrow.io and/or rowrow.io (DNS name pointing from original provider to Zeit.co).

Zeit deployment is auto-aliased to domain ```rowrow.io``` through _package.json_ entry:
````
 "now": {
    "name": "rowrow",
    "alias": "rowrow.io"
  }
````
Simply run ```now && now alias``` to deploy and alias in one step.

Wow :)
